# FPGA Motor Control

The challenge of this project is to design a pulse-width modulator signal generator in VHDL for use on a Xilinx FPGA to control a DC motor. The program must allow for the PWM signal to vary duty-cycle percentage by tens (e.g. 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.), ideally through the manipulation of a rotary shaft encoder. The signal will be sent through an external accessory header pin to control the motor.

This project was completed as a requirement for ECE 102, Digital Systems, for the completion of an undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
